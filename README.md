### Fish parasite species distribution modeling

> This repository contains project files (data, analysis, and manuscript) for a term project for [Perspectives in Computational Ecology](http://daphnia.ecology.uga.edu/ecol8910-spring2015/). 


### Goals:

* To predict parasite occurrence among a suite of potential host species for a large number of freshwater fish parasites. 

* To determine the relative importance of geography, host traits, and parasite community structure in constraining what hosts a parasite infects.

Supplement:

* To determine how predictive power varies as a function of parasite taxonomy or host specificity.
