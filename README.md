### Goals:

I want to be able to predict parasite occurrences given a set of host species. To do this, I aim to apply different machine learning algorithms (SVM, BRT, random forest), more traditional methods (logistic regression), and (maybe) develop a method using density ratio estimation to determine predictive accuracy of trained models, and perhaps provide information on which host traits are most informative to predict parasite occurrences.

This is super general, but I plan to make it a bit more targeted soon.
